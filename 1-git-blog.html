  <h1>Version Control, Git, and Github</h1>
  <h2>A brief primer</h2>

  <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
    <p>
      No matter what it is that you're looking to do, controlling different versions of your project will do nothing but make your life easier. Whether you're a musician, a writer or a 3D modeller you'll likely have run into a situation in which a change you made to your project didn't go as intended. This is why version control is so important, it allows for full creative input into a project without any repercussions. Controlling the version of your project will prevent you from ever ruining what you're working on by allowing you to make changes in a protected environment and restore previous versions of your project if need be.

    <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
    <p>
        Git is comparable to a savepoint in a video game. Every time you make progress, or when you finally make it through a tough area, you save your progress so that you won't have to repeat it again. Likewise, if you know you're going into a harder portion of the game you'd want to save directly before it so that a failed attempt won't cause you too great of a setback. Git acts like this but for code. Git allows you to make changes to make branches of your code, which can be thought of as environments where changes can be made freely without worry of ruining the software as a whole. Git also allows you revert changes you've made to your code, in the event that you implement something that causes an unforeseen issue.
    <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
    </p>
        Using GitHub to store your code has many benefits to it. It's always important to keep offsite backups of important files, so having your code on GitHub will allow you to have an updatable backup of your code should something happen to your machine. However, GitHub's real utility lies in how it allows developers to collaborate on projects. GitHub has been instrumental in the open source software community because it allows developers to post their code and get contributions from other developers or open source software enthusiasts. GitHub has provided a platform for open source software that makes community contribution a streamlined process.
