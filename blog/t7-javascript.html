              While Ruby and Javascript are very different languages in almost every category, like with most programming languages there are similarities between the two. In particular, Objects in JS and hashes in Ruby are comparable. They both appear similar syntactically, and functionally they behave in similar ways. Objects in JS can have properties, and those properties can have values that can be manipulated. In the same vein, hashes in Ruby have keys/value pairs that can be accessed and updated. Let's check out the syntax of both of them. In JS objects looke like:
              <br>
              <br>
              <code>
              var jsObject = {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}
              </code>
              <br>
              <br>
              and can be accessed by calling jsObject.x, which would output 1. In Ruby, the syntax for hashes is nearly the same when using symbols instead of the hash rocket notation.
              <br>
              <br>
              <code>
              rubyHash = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
              </code>
              <br>
              <br>
              Differently from JS, key/value pairs in Ruby are accessed/updated via rubyHash[a] as compared to using dot notation in JS.
