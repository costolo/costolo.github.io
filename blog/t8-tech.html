              A common paradigm in web design is the MVC pattern. MVC, or Model-view-controller, is an architectural pattern that allows for the separation of implementing the user interface of an application into three different components. 
            </p>
            <h3>the model</h3>
            <p>
                The model component of MVC is responsible for updating the view and controller when a change to the application state has been made. The view will update in regards to the change, and the controller will change what functionality will be available to the user depending on what change has been made.
            </p>
            <h3>the view</h3>
            <p>
                Potentially the most straightforward of the three MVC components, the view component is responsible for what the user sees and interacts with on their end. It gets the information that it represents to the user from the model.
            </p>
            <h3>the controller</h3>
            <p>
              The controller sends commands to the model in order to update the model's state, which in turn results in the overall experience that the user takes in.
            </p>
            <h3>tying the three together with active record</h3>
            <p>
                Now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about Active Record. Active Record in Rails is essentially the model in MVC. It represents the underlying data and logic of the application. It unifies these two by creating a persistable (aka underlying, or transcendent) model of objects and database tables. Ultimately, Active Record is an implementation of Object Relational Mapping, which can be broken down in simpler terms to be a programming solution to converting data between incompatible types
                (see ruby objects and database tables). The power of Active Record in Rails is what it provides via inheritance. Seeing something similar to:
                <br>
                <br>
                <code>
                  class sampleClass < ActiveRecord::Base
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                in a Rails model file is very common. Active Record is the reason that rails applications can be a robust Etsy or Twitter, as it allows for communication between objects and databases.
