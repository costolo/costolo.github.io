              It's impossible to achieve the best results in any venture without challenging yourself. It takes effort and can easily cause stress, but when it comes to creating or learning it is necessary. DBC has definitely been a challenge thus far, even though we are only three weeks in. There isn't much hand holding and you really are responsible for what you get out of the program. I've always considered myself to be a quick learner, but I've quickly learned that this curriculum isn't something that can be breezed through. DBC has really been an exercise in stepping out of your comfort zone. I'm lucky enough to be competent with most learning styles, so a combination of reading and experimenting on my own has brought me a long way in these last three weeks. I had a background with basic git, html, css, and ruby, but I'm already feeling far more competent with them than I had before. I'm excited to see where this takes me, and how I'll end up when I'm on the other side.
