              Having to work cooperatively on a project has always been something that I've both enjoyed, but also been wary of. Collaboration is great, but it can easily lead to stress and anxiety depending on how the pair functions together. For me, there is always a sense of vulnerability initially, as I worry about whether or not I will be able to convey myself in a way that makes sense to the person that I am working with. However, as with most benefiucial things I think that pair programming is also an exercise in stepping out of your comfort zone. It can be a little nerve-wracking initially, but in my experience it has always worked out in the end. An important component of pairing is the feedback given afterward. Good feedback really gives insight into how you are treating others, and if the strategies you're using are effective. Good feedback should be specific, it should provide examples of what worked and what didn't work, and above all else it should be kind. The point of feedback is to give someone information on what they did well, and what they can improve on. While I'm always nervous to check my feedback, DBCs emphasis on keeping feedback kind, specific and actionable has made me more comfortable reading what others have to say about our sessions. As a whole I think DBC has really created a positive system for allowing people to learn from each other.
