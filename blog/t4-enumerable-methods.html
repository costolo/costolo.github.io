              The enumerable mixin provides many instance methods that can have some type of searching or iterating capabilities. One very useful method, map, will return an array in which every element has had the specified block run on it. For instance:
                <br>
                <br>
                <code>
                  [1,2,3,4,5].map { |x| x*2}
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                would output
                <br>
                <br>
                <code>
                  [2,4,6,8,10]
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Map can be thought of as being similar to the each method in terms of iteration, however map returns a new array. This simple but powerful method can be used to accomplish a great number of tasks, and because it accepts a block
                the possibilities of what can be done are near endless.
