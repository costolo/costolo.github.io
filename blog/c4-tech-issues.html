              In the most basic of terms, net neutrality refers to preserving the internet as an open playing field for all competitors using it. From Netflix to early stage startups, an open internet ensures that every commercial entity can be accessed at the same speed. There are many problems that would arise from allowing ISPs to preferentially route traffic, but the greatest would be the sheer stifling of competition that would occur. Internet fast lanes would make the barrier of entry into the market even greater for young companies, and would decentivize larger companies from providing better services, as they wouldn't have to fear competition.

              Luckily, last month a major breakthrough was made on the net neutrality front. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler announced the FCCs plans to attempt to regulate ISPs as if the internet were a utility, similar to electricity or water. These tighter regulations would prevent ISPs from preferentially routing traffic to companies that have enough money to pay for it, and would instead preserve the internet in the form that we know of it now. While this has been attempted twice before, its success will be monumental in ensuring that the internet remains an entity that promotes competition and growth over monopolization and stagnation
