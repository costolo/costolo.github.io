              Arrays and hashes are two very versatile and powerful concepts in computer science. At their most fundamental state, they are indexed lists. In ruby they can contain different data types like integers and strings. The real difference between the two lies in how their elements are stored and accessed.
            </p>
            <h3>Arrays</h3>
            <p>
                Arrays can be thought of as lists. They contain an ordered sequence of data that can be modefied at any point. Array syntax looks something like:
                <br>
                <br>
                <code>
                  ary = ["data", "you", "want", "to", "store"]
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                and each of those elements can be accessed with
                <br>
                <br>
                <code>
                  ary[element_integer]
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                where element_integer is the integer value associated with the element. For instance,
                 <br>
                <br>
                <code>
                  ary[0]
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                would return the string "data."
            </p>
            <p>
                However, arrays can store many other data types. You can even have an array of arrays!
            </p>
            <h3>Hashes</h3>
            <p>
              Hashes, too, are indexed lists. However, hashes contain two distinct values, a key and an associated value. So a theoretical hash of:
               <br>
                <br>
                <code>
                  earth_wind_fire = { vocals: "maruice white", bass: "verdine white", piano: "wade flemons" }
                </code>
                <br>
                <br>
                has the keys vocals, bass, and piano, and each of those keys access a unique value. In this case they access strings, however they are not limited to that. Hashes can be initialized with a default value, otherwise accessing an element that doesn't exist will return nil.
