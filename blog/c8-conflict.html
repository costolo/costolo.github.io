              I'm a pretty non-confrontational person, so this blog post is a little difficult for me because I really haven't been involved in that many memorable conflicts. To keep things recent, my roommate and I got into an argument over the finale of season 3 of House of Cards. I'll try to keep away from spoilers, so in short a petty argument about plot choices led to some name-calling (Ã  la "you're like an alcoholic twelve year old who just saw the Jimmy Neutron Movie for the first time") and general bitterness on both parts. Looking back at it, the whole situation seemed to result from an escalation of jokes that started as friendly jabs and ended as attacks on character. In the heat of the moment this escalation is hard to curb, because firing back feels like a natural defense mechanism. While resolving conflicts large or small is certainly something that should be undertaken by feuding indiviuals, ultimately a weekend apart (shoutouts to PAX East for keeping him out of my hair this weekend/preserving my overall mental health) was really all it took for the ninth circle of Hell that was our apartment to cool down to a more comfortable second or first circle. In an attempt to learn something from the general immaturity that was this situation, being emotionally developed enough to not let jabs become insults (or more importantly refraining from insulting friends in general) is certainly something that should be practiced. Limiting alcohol consumption could also probably help, though there's no scientific concensus to back this up at the moment.
