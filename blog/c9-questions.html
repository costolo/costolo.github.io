              Whether you're curious about code or cars, there are many avenues in which a question can be phrased. I'm under the opinion that an effective question can be broken into two parts: the context, and the problem. I think that it's important to keep questions as succinct as possible so that you can help to not drown the person you're questioning in auxilliary information. The last thing that you want to do when asking someone a question is confusing them to the point where they're unsure of what you're talking about.

            <h3>the context</h3>
            <p>
              The context of a question is just as important as the actual question itself. Conveying enough surrounding information about your problem will help to bring the questionee up to speed with what you were doing when you encountered your problem. It's important to practice brevity when providing context, as there is certainly such a thing as providing too much context. Try to limit yourself to only giving information that is directly related to the problem/what you are attempting to accomplish.
            </p>
            <h3>the problem</h3>
            <p>
                The problem portion of a question is significantly easier to convey (typically), as you can tell or show the questionee exactly what is happening. The questionee won't always understand the problem at a first glance, but providing them context as well as the problem will help them to formulate a plan of attack or alternative strategy.
