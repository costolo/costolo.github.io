              Creating a blog website from strictly HTML and CSS was a lot of fun and a great learning experience, but it left much to be desired in terms of functionality. Initially I had been displaying blog posts by just typing them directly into blog/index.html, but that felt redundant because I was already creating individual files for each blog post. What I wanted was a way to reference each "blogtitle.html" file within blog/index.html. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution I employed for this was by utilizing a very simple jQuery script:
                <br>
                <pre style="text-align:left; color:white">
                 <br>&lt;script src=&quot;jquery-1.11.2.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; <br>&lt;script&gt; <br/>$(document).ready(function(){<br/>$(&quot;#idForDiv&quot;).load(&quot;name-of-blogpost.html&quot;)<br/>});<br/>&lt;/script&gt; 
                </pre>
                <p>Then, in the div that I use as a container for the posts themselves I included:</p>
                
                <p>
                <pre style="text-align:left; color:white">
                  <br>&lt;div id=&quot;idForDiv&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                </pre>
                </p>
            <p>
                What this does is utilize jQuery's load function, which does exactly as the name implies, it can be used to load files. Then all that is required is for you to do is to just use the same ID in the script and div/whatever element your blog posts should end up in. It's that easy!
            </p>
            <p>
              Unless you're me, in which case you'll find that nothing seems to go smoothly at first. After installing jQuery and making sure that I had the script correct, I still wasn't getting the results that I expected. After inpsecting Chrome's console, I found that I was getting the error:
            </p>

              <pre style="text-align:left; color:white; word-wrap:break-word;">
              <br>XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///Users/ben/DBC/costolo.github.io/blog/t2-css-design.html. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.
              </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              How it was explained to me by a seasoned webdev friend of mine was that "modern day browsers don't like javascript accessing filesystems." A simple workaround for local development (which I'm using fulltime now) is to run
              <pre style="text-align:left; color:white">
              <br>python -m SimpleHTTPServer
              </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
            in the directory that your index.html file is. Doing so will start a WEBrick server that can be accessed by going to localhost:8000 in your web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
            After undergoing all of this, I finally ended up with the situation I was aiming for. From now on I can create new html files for each blog post, and then reference them in blog/index.html with a single line of jQuery. All it takes is just creating different IDs for each blog post and different corresponding divs.
