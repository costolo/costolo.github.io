              Ruby is a class-based, object oriented programming language. In simplest terms, classes in Ruby are a way to organize data structures like arrays and strings, as well as methods into a single entity. Classes can be used to represent anything in the real world, and one of the most elegent examples of this comes from Sandi Metz in Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby. For this example, we'll consider the gear ratio on a bicycle. A bike's gear ratio can be calculated by dividing the number of teeth on the chainring (the gear attached to the pedals) by the number of teeth on the cog (the gear attached to the rear wheel). Using my bike as an example, my chainring has 42 teeth and my cog has 15 teeth, making my gear ratio 2.8. To translate this into Ruby, we could make a simple gear ratio calculator application by writing
              <br>
              <br>
              <code style="white-space:pre-line">
              class Gear
                attr_reader :chainring, :cog
                def initialize(chainring, cog)
                  @chainring = chainring
                  @cog = cog
                end
                
                def ratio
                  chainring/cog.to_f
                end
              end
              </code>
              <br>
              <br>
              So what we've done here is established the Gear class, which accepts the arguments chainring and cog, respectively. In order to utilize this class, we'll need to first create a Gear object and then pass messages to it in the form of method calls. We can do this by writing

              gear = Gear.new(42, 15)
              p gear.ratio #will output 2.8

              In these lines the object is created and initialized with chainring and cog arguments, and then the ratio method is called. Further on in POODR, Sandi Metz goes on further to write a wheel class, so that the gear inches of a bike can be calculated. In terms of application design, seperating classes and methods to only having a single responsibility is ideal, as it allows for good scaling and helps to make future changes go more smoothly. The power of classes in Ruby goes beyond organization, though. It provides you with a way to create your own objects that behave specifically how you intend them to, which allows for large amounts of customization and creativity.
