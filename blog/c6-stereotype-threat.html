              While I'm thoroughly excited that I have the opportunity to take part in DBC, one of my largest concerns is how my future interactions with the web and software development communities will go. Given that I was formally trained to be a microbiologist, I don't have a background in engineering or computer science. There is definitely a feeling of being an outsider since I won't have a "formal" education. This is something that scares me, but it also motivates me. I want to be able to prove to those that I meet that I am a capable programmer, and that my lack of traditional education in computer science isn't something that holds me back. Whether it's rational or not, I want to be able to convince others of my ability through my actions, and not through credentials alone.
