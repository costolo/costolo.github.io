          <h3>static positioning</h3>
            <p>
              This is the default positining for elements, so the element will appear exactly where it should. 
            </p>

          <h3>relative positioning</h3>
            <p>
              Relative positioning allows for the top/bottom and left/right commands to be used in order for elements to be moved on an X/Y plane.

              For instance

              <code>
              div1{
                position:relative;
                top:55px;
                right:-80px;
              }
              </code>

              would position div1 55 pixels from the top of the page and 80 pixels to the left of the elements static position
            </p>
          <h3>absolute positioning</h3>
            <p>
                Absolute positioning also allows for top/bottom and left/right in the same manner as relative positioning, but the key difference is that with position:absolute the element will go <b>exactly</b> where you tell it to, instead of cooperating and altering its position based on other nearby elements.
