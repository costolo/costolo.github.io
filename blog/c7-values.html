              Determining what values shape who I am is a topic that seems to come up frequently, but not one that I've ever put a good deal of thought into. I think that creativity is what I strive to achieve in what I do. Whether it's coding or anything else, approaching problems from different mindsets is something that I've tried to do. A lot of my appreciation and enjoyment for programming comes from the fact that there's never only one solution to a problem, and while I enjoyed studying microbiology as a discipline I never got the same sense of satisfaction that I get from solving a problem with code. While I'm not entirely sure what stereotype threats I may face in my future, I'm hoping that keeping a round about approach to looking at problems will help me to solve them and have fun doing so.

              The last topic I had to ask for advice on was actually about whether or not I should attend DBC. I ran the idea by a close friend so that I could get some feedback on whether or not I was totally out of my mind.
