      What interested me in DBC over other coding bootcamps was the sense of culture that the organization instills. While I love learning programming concepts and how to code, I didn't want to jump head first into a program that was just going to pump out junior devs and nothing more. My impression of DBC over other coding bootcamps was that it was more authentic, and was much more focused on self improvement and learning than simply moulding people into a one size fits all developer model. After completing my first week of phase 0, my excitement only further grows. I really appreciate that the creator mindset is being celebrated, as I haven't really experienced much of that up until this point. I'm definitely nervous for what is to come, but it's an excited nervousness. I feel that I'm taking control of my future and defining the path that I want to follow myself, and that in and of itself drives me forward.
